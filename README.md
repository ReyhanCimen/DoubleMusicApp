# Dual Audio Player for Focus and Ambience

A lightweight desktop application built with Electron that allows users to play two audio tracks simultaneously and manage them from a single interface.


## Overview

The application is designed to improve focus by combining an ambient background sound, such as brown noise, with a separate melodic or foreground music track. This setup removes the need to switch between multiple audio players and enables a more controlled and intentional listening experience.


## Current Status

At the moment, audio files are added directly through the codebase. Support for adding music files via drag and drop is planned for a future update.
